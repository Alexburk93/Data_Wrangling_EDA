# Introduction

Suicide is the deliberate act of ending one’s own life, often stemming from various mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, autism, schizophrenia, and personality disorders, as well as external stressors like financial struggles, academic pressures, relationship issues, or experiences of harassment and bullying. Factors like substance abuse, including alcoholism and benzodiazepine use, also contribute to this tragic outcome. Previous suicide attempts significantly elevate the risk of future attempts.
Efforts to prevent suicide involve a multifaceted approach, including restricting access to common methods like firearms, drugs, and poisons, addressing mental health issues and substance abuse, responsible media reporting on suicides, and fostering better economic conditions. Despite the widespread availability of crisis hotlines, their effectiveness remains inadequately researched.
The prevalence and methods of suicide vary across countries, often influenced by the accessibility of lethal means. Hanging, pesticide ingestion, poisoning, and firearms are among the most commonly used methods. Globally, suicides claim over 700,000 lives annually, ranking suicide as the 10th leading cause of death worldwide.
Approximately 1.5% of people die by suicide, translating to roughly 12 per 100,000 individuals each year. Men are more likely to die by suicide than women, with rates ranging from 1.5 times higher in developing countries to 3.5 times higher in developed ones. Financial strain often exacerbates the risk of suicide. [1]

## Title: A Study for Effects of Economic Growth Rate and Unemployment Rate to Suicide Rate in Korea

Author: Jong Soon Park, June Young Lee, Soon Duck Kim
Objectives: We investigated the effects of the economic growth and unemployment rates on the suicide rate in Korea, between 1983 and 2000, using a time-series regression model. The purpose of this study was to model and test the magnitude of the rate of suicide, with the Korean unemployment rate and GDP. [2]

Conclusion: It was found that the suicide rate was closely related to the National’s economic status of Korea, which is similar to the results found in studies in other countries. We expected, therefore, that this study could be used as the basis for further suicide-related studies. [2]

## Title: Ten-year evolution of suicide rates and economic indicators in large Brazilian urban centers

Author: Asevedo Elson, Ziebold Carolina, Diniz Elton, Gadelha Ary, Mari Jair
Purpose of review: This was a retrospective ecological study to examine the relationship between suicide rates and economic indicators in large Brazilian urban centers. Data on macroeconomic indicators (GDP and unemployment rates) and suicide rates of the largest Brazilian cities were collected from January 2006 to December 2015. [3]
Summary The effect of economic indicators was heterogeneous among the centers, but, overall, the variation in suicide rates was inversely related to unemployment and did not show a significant relationship with GDP. These findings indicate a more complex link between economics and suicide whenever looking at local regional indicators. Further research should focus on possible intervening factors, what may inform better preventive interventions. [3]

## Title: The association between nation-level social and economic indices and suicide rates: A pilot study

Author: Ravi Philip Rajkumar
Introduction Suicide is one of the leading causes of premature mortality worldwide. An analysis of global suicide data for the period 1990–2016, covering 195 countries, found that suicide was among the ten leading causes of years of life lost in Europe, the Americas and the Asia-Pacific region (Naghavi, 2019). Because of this, suicide prevention has been accorded one of the highest priorities in national and international public health plans, such as the World Health Organization’s Comprehensive Mental Health Action Plan (World Health Organization, 2021). The act of suicide is a complex behavior which results from the interaction between an innate diathesis and external stressors (van Heeringen, 2012). [4]
Conclusions Social factors are important determinants of suicide. Despite certain limitations, the results of the current study suggest that sustainable development may play a role in the mitigation of suicide risk, Economic inequality may contribute to variations in suicide risk, particularly in men. Moreover, the strength and direction of the associations between socioeconomic factors and suicide varies across income groups, highlighting the need for an in-depth understanding of each country’s social, cultural and economic profile when planning large-scale social interventions aimed at suicide prevention. [4]

## Title:Is Happiness the main cause for the rising suicide rate in the world?

Author: Bong Jin Haw, Chong Yock Loon, Tai Hong Ting, Teoh Kah Chun, Wong Chin Hing
Introduction This study investigates the impact of happiness on suicide rate. Beside theimpact of happiness, employment, gross domestic product, education, health expenditure and population on the suicide rate is also studied. The study divides the data into three sets including 31 developed and developing countries, 26 developed countries, and 5 developing countries. A significant relationship between happiness and the suicide rate is found in developing countries. [5]
Conclusions Surprisingly, based on the result it can be concluded that the happiness in developing countries will significantly impact and influence the suicide rate indeed. It is important to realize that the happiness is negatively affect the suicide rate in developing countries which means that increase in the happiness will subsequently lower down the suicide rate. Moreover, other economic factors such as employment, gross domestic product, government health expenditure, education and population are also included in this study to carry out their impact towards the suicide rate. [5]

# Research Question

Suicide is not confined to high-income countries; it is a global issue affecting all regions. Surprisingly, over 77% of suicides occur in low- and middle-income countries. However, high-income countries exhibit the highest age-standardized suicide rates. In ongoing research across 19 countries, we explore correlations between GDP, bankruptcy rates, happiness levels, and suicide rates. Understanding these intricate relationships is pivotal for policymakers, researchers, and stakeholders to devise effective interventions promoting mental well-being and economic resilience. Leveraging multidimensional datasets and advanced analytical methods, our project aims to illuminate these connections for the betterment of societies worldwide.

# Conclusion and Summary

This project provided a fascinating opportunity to delve into an unfamiliar topic, applying theoretical methods learned in class to a practical, real-world project. We perfomed an in-depth exploration using four distinct datasets: Suicide Rate, GDP per Capita, Bankruptcies, and Happiness Index. The years were spanning from 2011 to 2019. Our initial approach involved analyzing each dataset independently to understand its composition and conducting preliminary exploratory data analysis. This included tasks such as calculating and plotting the average annual values for each dataset across the globe.

Following this foundational analysis, we progressed to the data wrangling phase. We successfully merged the four datasets. The resultant combined dataset  included data from 19 countries, providing a  basis for further analysis. In the analytical phase, we wanted to uncover any potential correlations within the data set of these 19 countries. Our efforts to identify significant correlations among the datasets were unsuccessful.

To gain deeper insights, we narrowed our focus to two specific countries: Germany and South Africa. For each country, we conducted a detailed exploration of their data, plotting trends over the years and searching for any correlations between the variables within each national context. Our analysis did not reveal any significant correlations.

Given the absence of correlations in our initial analyses, we recognized the necessity to widen the dataset to enhance our study. Potential for expanding our dataset include incorporating additional variables such as alcohol and drug usage, unemployment rates, and sunshine hours in the countries studied. Additionally, transitioning from an annual to a monthly data overview might bring some benefit in exploring trends and correlations that were not visibile in the yearly data.
